# Purpose
Welcome to **system_info_more**, a Bash script that allows you to access various system information with ease. This script provides an interactive menu to choose from different options. Whether you need information about your current user, shell directory, CPU, memory, or more, this tool has you covered.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply run the script, and you'll be presented with a menu of system information options. You can select the options by entering the corresponding number, and the script will provide you with the requested information.

## How It Works

The script runs within a while loop, allowing you to select options continuously until you decide to exit. Each option corresponds to a specific system information query. The script will provide the requested information promptly.
